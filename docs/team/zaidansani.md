### Project: DocTrack

DocTrack is a desktop address book application intended for for General Practitioners (GPs) at small clinics who need to keep track of recurring patients. 

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
