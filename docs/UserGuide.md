## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.
- To install Java 17, download Java [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
- To check your Java version, refer [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#).

2. Download our latest release file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). It is a `.jar` file.
For more information, see this: 
- [What is a JAR file?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html)
- [How to run a JAR file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5774970/run-jar-file-in-command-prompt).
   

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DocTrack.


4. Open a command terminal of your preference, and run the commands:
    ```
    cd HOME_FOLDER
    java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```
    For example, if you copied `DocTrack.jar` into the folder `C:/Users/user/Documents`,
    run the commands:
    ```
   cd C:/Users/user/Documents
   java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```
    

5. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)


6. Type the command in the command box, which is indicated by `Enter command here...`. Press `Enter` to execute it. 
    * E.g. Typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>
   
   Some other examples of commands you can try:
   * `list person` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
   * `delete person 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear person` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Command Overview](#command-overview) below for details of each command.

## Interacting with DocTrack

All interactions with the DocTrack platform are done through a series of **commands** entered by the user. These commands allow you to perform various **tasks**, such as adding, editing, listing, and managing persons/appointments. The commands are designed to be flexible and user-friendly, allowing **data fields** in any order, handling multiple entries for specific fields.

Here are some **key points** to keep in mind when using commands:

- You should supply all the fields (words in `UPPER_CASE`) that are needed for a command.<br>
  e.g. in `add person n/NAME`, `NAME` is a field which can be used as `add person n/John Doe`.

- The `INDEX` in command formats like `person edit` and `person delete` refers to the index number (shown beside the person or appointment) in the displayed list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero times or more times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- You can add fields in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- If you add extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list person`, `list appt`, `exit` and `clear`), they will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is because some space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over.

## Command Overview

The following sections describe the various commands available in the DocTrack platform:

- [Person Commands](#person-commands)
- [Appointment Commands](#appointment-commands)
- [General Commands](#general-commands)

### Person Commands

A **person** is a patient with several fields: a name, a phone number, an email, an address and optional tags. These patients can be uniquely identified by their **patient ID (PID)** for easy reference. DocTrack allows you interact with patient information through different commands, which can be seen below.

<br>

##### Adding a person: `add person`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add person n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

- `add person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

- Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- Existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit person 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Only the name is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

- `find person John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

##### Saving the data

##### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How is my data stored?<br>
**A**: The data is stored in [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files, located in the `data` folder. The details of patients are stored in the `addressbook.json` file, while the appointments are stored in the `appointmentbook.json` file.
Examples:

<img src="images/json/addressbook.png" alt="Address Book JSON" width="300" height="auto">
<img src="images/json/appointmentBook.png" alt="Appointment Book JSON" width="300" height="auto">

<br><br>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data (in the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files) to another 
computer?<br>
**A**: [Install the DocTrack app](#quick-start) in the other computer. When you run it, it creates empty [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files in the `data` folder. Replace these empty files with the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files from your previous computer.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
