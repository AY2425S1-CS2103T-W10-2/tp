## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete  person 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Appointment` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>

The `Model` component,

* with regards to `Person` objects:
  * stores the details of a person in a `PersonDescriptor` object
  * stores the `PersonDescriptor` object with a `personId` in the `Person` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* with regards to `Appointment` objects:
  * stores the details of an appointment in a `AppointmentDescriptor` object
  * stores the `AppointmentDescriptor` object with a `appointmentId` in the `Appointment` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list (the `UniqueTagList`) in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. Similarly, the `Appointment` objects are shown as such as well.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save patient data, appointment data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Storage interface inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Patient data : 
  * data is saved in `JsonAddressBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AddressBookStorage`.
  * data is saved as `JsonSerializableAddressBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedTag` which embodies the actual data of the individual patient and their data
* Appointment data:
  * data is saved in `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AppointmentBookStorage`.
  * data is saved as `JsonSerializableAppointmentBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedAppointment` which embodies the actual data of appointments and appointment details
* User Preference data:
    * data is saved in `UserPrefsStorage` interface and saves as `JsonUserPrefsStorage`
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## **Flow**

The activity diagram shows the general sequence of steps when a user interacts with DocTrack.

<puml src="diagrams/OverallFlowActivityDiagram.puml" width="700"></puml>

1. The user types a command in the `CommandBox`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command.
3. If the command is a known command and is in a valid format, a parser creates the corresponding 
   `Command` object. Else, an error is displayed. 
4. The `Command` object is executed.
5. The `UI` displays the result of the command execution to the user.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## **Implementation of main features**

## **Implementation of Entity Commands**
Entity commands include `add`, `delete`, `find`, `clear` commands.
So `xyzCommand` can be `addPersonCommand`, `addCommandParser` and so on.

**Step 1**. The user types an `xyz` command in the `CommandBox`, followed by the type of entity `person` or `appt`. This is followed by appropriate arguments and prefixes.


**Step 2**. The command is passed to the `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` then calls the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the command.


**Step 3**. The `AddressBookParser` creates a `xyzEntityCommand` object, and call the `xyzCommandParser::parse` method, which is returned to the `LogicManager`. This may be different based on the entity type as commands like `addPersonCommand` and `addApptCommand` have a different set of arguments the user can provide. 


**Step 4**. The `LogicManager` calls the `xyzCommand : execute` method which creates a `CommandResult` Object.

**Step 5**. The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

<puml src="diagrams/EntityCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EntityCommandSequenceDiagram"></puml>
- The entity referred in `FindEntityCommand` etc, refers to `FindPersonCommand` and `FindAppointmentCommand` because we have two entities called person and appointment on which operations can be performed.


#### Find Appointment Command
**Aspect: How to show find appointment.**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Find the information based on what the user has provided (name, date).
  - Pros: Fast and easy to find by date and name
  - Cons: Confusing syntax from user's perspective

- **Alternative 2**: Create different find commands, find by date, find by name etc.
  - Pros: Much easy in terms of user experience
  - Cons: Harder to implement as more code needs to be written.

<br>

### List appointment feature

#### Implementation

**Aspect**: How to show list 

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Print them out individually on the listpanel
  - Pros: Easy to scroll through
  - Cons: Might look cluttered to some users


#### Design considerations

<br>

### Clear appointment feature


#### Design considerations

**Aspect**: How to show list

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Replace the appointment book with a new appointment book.

<br>

---

<br>

## Implementation of general features
General commands include the `exit` and `help` commands.

The sequence diagram shows how a general command (`ExitCommand` or `HelpCommand`) is executed:
<puml src="diagrams/GeneralCommandsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600"></puml>

**Step 1.** The user types an `xyz` command (`exit` or `help`) in the `CommandBox`, which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the `xyz` command.

**Step 3.** The `AddressBookParser` creates an `XYZCommand` object, which is returned to the 
`LogicManager`. The `XYZCommand` object can be an `ExitCommand` or a `HelpCommand`.

**Step 4.** The `LogicManager` calls the `XYZCommand::execute` method, which creates a new `CommandResult` 
object.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

<br>

### Exit feature
#### Implementation
When a user types an `exit` command, the DocTrack application will exit.
  
<br>

### Help feature
#### Implementation

When a user types a `help` command, the DocTrack application will display a `HelpWindow`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to display help information:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display help information in a new window.
  * Pros: Keeps the main application window uncluttered.
  * Cons: Requires managing an additional window.

* **Alternative 2:** Display help information in a modal dialog.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement.
  * Cons: Can clutter the main application window and interrupt the user's workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## **Appendix: Data storage and files**
- The data of the patients and appointments is stored in the `data` folder.
  - Patient data is stored in `data/addressbook.json`.
  - Appointment data is stored in `data/appointmentbook.json`.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Note:**
For `Appointment`, the fields `Sickness` and `Medicine` are optional. Hence, if `Sickness` or `Medicine` 
is not specified, it would be represented as `"null"`, in the `appointmentbook.json` file.
</box>

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: When the data is updated in the `.json` file:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically save all changes after any command that changes the data. 
    * Pros: Simplifies the process for the user, without needing to save manually.
    * Cons: May be slow if there are many changes to save.


* **Alternative 2:** Prompt the user to save changes before exiting.
    * Pros: Gives the user more control over the saving process.
    * Cons: May be annoying for users who do not want an additional step to save changes.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

<br>

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* General Practitioners (GPs) at small clinics

**Value proposition**: Time spent looking through paper medical documents should be spent in other life-saving activities. Our product resolves this issue by creating fast access to patient contact details as well as their relevant appointment/treatment details, allowing GPs to contact and monitor their patients easily.

## **Appendix: UI**

### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to show appointment and person lists**
<br>
Context: There are two entity types (appointment and person) being managed in DocTrack
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show lists as two separate panels side by side
    * Pros:
        * Easier to see all information at once
        * Easier to cross reference when doing `add appt` or `edit appt` commands, which may need information about person ID
    * Cons:
        * More verbose and could result in information overload
* **Alternative 2**: Show only one list at a time, but toggle between the two using a `list appt` or `list person` command
    * Pros:
        * Information is simpler to digest
    * Cons:
        * More overhead of handling switching between lists
        * Difficult to cross reference when typing certain commands

<br>

**Aspect: Color Scheme**
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create new red, white and gray color scheme
    * Pros:
        * Creates brand identity
        * Makes the GUI more appealling to the target audience
    * Cons:
        * Constant oversight needed to maintain color scheme in future feature enhancements
* **Alternative 2:** Use the original AB3 gray color schee
    * Pros:
        * No extra effort needed
    * Cons:
        * Colors are not appealing
        * Colors are not professional and do not suit target audience

## **Appendix: Effort**
#### Difficulty Level
Our project presented a higher level of complexity compared to AB3. Our project involved handling multiple entity types, mainly persons and appointments, whereas AB3 manages only a single entity. This increased the requirements for command processing as each entity type has additional attributes and methods.

#### Challenges Faced
- **Integration of person and appointment entities**: To ensure that each appointment correctly linked to each patient, we introduced a `Patient` attribute to the `Appointment` class. 
- **Command Implementation**: Implementing commands for both entities required careful design to ensure that each command worked correctly for both entities.
- **Unique IDs**: To ensure each patient and appointment had a 
  unique ID to allow for easy retrieval and updating of data, we added a `personId` and `appointmentId` attribute to the `Person` and `Appointment` classes respectively.

#### Effort Required
Our project involved substantial effort in several key areas:
- **Design and Refactoring**: Extending the AB3 framework to handle two separate entity types required refactoring and designing new classes. 
- **Command Implementation**: In creating patient- and appointment-specific commands, we implemented additional parser classes and commands.
- **Testing and Debugging**: To ensure robust funtionality, we implemented comprehensive test cases. This was necessary to ensure 
  that each command and feature worked as expected for both entity types.

#### Achievements
Our project successfully expanded AB3â€™s functionality, enabling the application to manage patients and appointments. Despite the challenges, our final solution provides a user-friendly interface and coherent command structure. Additionally, the design allows for potential future expansion to include other entity types without extensive restructuring, making the system both flexible and scalable.
