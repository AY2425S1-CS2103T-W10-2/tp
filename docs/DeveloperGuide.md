## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete  person 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Appointment` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>

The `Model` component,

* with regards to `Person` objects:
  * stores the details of a person in a `PersonDescriptor` object
  * stores the `PersonDescriptor` object with a `personId` in the `Person` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* with regards to `Appointment` objects:
  * stores the details of an appointment in a `AppointmentDescriptor` object
  * stores the `AppointmentDescriptor` object with a `appointmentId` in the `Appointment` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list (the `UniqueTagList`) in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. Similarly, the `Appointment` objects are shown as such as well.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save patient data, appointment data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Storage interface inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Patient data : 
  * data is saved in `JsonAddressBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AddressBookStorage`.
  * data is saved as `JsonSerializableAddressBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedTag` which embodies the actual data of the individual patient and their data
* Appointment data:
  * data is saved in `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AppointmentBookStorage`.
  * data is saved as `JsonSerializableAppointmentBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedAppointment` which embodies the actual data of appointments and appointment details
* User Preference data:
    * data is saved in `UserPrefsStorage` interface and saves as `JsonUserPrefsStorage`
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Flow**

The activity diagram shows the general sequence of steps when a user interacts with DocTrack.

<puml src="diagrams/OverallFlowActivityDiagram.puml" width="700"></puml>

1. The user types a command in the `CommandBox`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command.
3. If the command is a known command and is in a valid format, a parser creates the corresponding 
   `Command` object. Else, an error is displayed. 
4. The `Command` object is executed.
5. The `UI` displays the result of the command execution to the user.

## Implementation of general features

### Exit feature
#### Implementation
When a user types an `exit` command, the DocTrack application will exit.

The sequence diagram shows how an `exit` command is executed:
<puml src="diagrams/ExitSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600"></puml>

**Step 1.** The user types the `exit` command in the `CommandBox`, which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the `exit` command.

**Step 3.** The `AddressBookParser` creates an `ExitCommand` object, which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 4.** The `LogicManager` calls the `ExitCommand::execute` method, which creates a new `CommandResult` object.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to handle unsaved data on exit:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically save all changes on exit.
  * Pros: Simplifies the exit process for the user. Ensures no data is lost.
  * Cons: May be slow if there are many changes to save.


* **Alternative 2:** Prompt the user to save changes before exiting.
    * Pros: Gives the user more control over the saving process.
    * Cons: May be annoying for users who do not want an additional step to save changes.
  
<br>

### Help feature
#### Implementation

When a user types a `help` command, the DocTrack application will display a `HelpWindow`.

The sequence diagram shows how a `help` command is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/HelpSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600"></puml>

**Step 1.** The user types the `help` command in the `CommandBox`, which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the `help` command.

**Step 3.** The `AddressBookParser` creates a `HelpCommand` object, which is returned to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 4.** The `LogicManager` calls the `HelpCommand::execute` method, which creates a new 
`CommandResult` object.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to display help information:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display help information in a new window.
  * Pros: Keeps the main application window uncluttered.
  * Cons: Requires managing an additional window.

* **Alternative 2:** Display help information in a modal dialog.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement.
  * Cons: Can clutter the main application window and interrupt the user's workflow.

## Proposed features

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

**Step 2.** The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

**Step 3.** The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

**Step 4.** The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

**Step 5.** The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

**Step 6.** The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

Steps 1 to 6 will similarly be implemented for the `Appointment` data. The `VersionedAppointmentBook` will 
be initialized with the initial appointment book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that 
single appointment book state. The `commit`, `undo`, and `redo` operations for `VersionedAppointmentBook` 
will be implemented in the same way as the `VersionedAddressBook`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Data storage and files**
- The data of the patients and appointments is stored in the `data` folder.
  - Patient data is stored in `data/addressbook.json`.
  - Appointment data is stored in `data/appointmentbook.json`.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Note:**
For `Appointment`, the fields `Sickness` and `Medicine` are optional. Hence, if `Sickness` or `Medicine` 
is not specified, it would be represented as `"null"`, in the `appointmentbook.json` file.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

<br>

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* General Practitioners (GPs) at small clinics

**Value proposition**: Time spent looking through paper medical documents should be spent in other life-saving activities. Our product resolves this issue by creating fast access to patient contact details as well as their relevant appointment/treatment details, allowing GPs to contact and monitor their patients easily.

<br>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding a person

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

## **Appendix: Effort**

We highly recommend adding an appendix named Appendix: Effort that evaluators can use to estimate the total project effort.
- Keep it brief (~1 page)
- Explain the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of the project. 
- If a significant part (e.g., more than 5%) of the effort was saved through reuse, mention what you reused and how it affected the effort e.g., the feature X is implemented using library Foo -- our work on adapting Foo to our product is contained in class FooAdapter.java. 
- Use AB3 as a reference point e.g., you can explain that while AB3 deals with only one entity type, your project was harder because it deals with multiple entity types.
